Insight - The purchase group are divided in 3 using their prior purchases
- High Very loyal - Average Ratings 3.03
- Medium Loyal - Average Ratigs 3.00
- Low Not loyal - Average Ratings 2.96

  #### Average Product Cost by Level of Importance

  Average Costs:
- Low: $212.06
- Medium: $209.38
- High: $203.87

Insight: Surprisingly, high importance products cost less on average â€” possibly due to discounts or streamlined inventory.

#### Prior Purchase By Product Importance

- Products marked Low had the highest repeat purchases 19K
- High importance products had the lowest repeat count 3K
- While medium importance product had over repeat purchase count 17k

Insight: Low importance items drive volume; high importance products may be niche or high cost.


#### Impact of Warehouse Block on Shipping Duration

- Warehouse F and D had the most late deliveries
- Warehouse C showed better performance (more on time deliveries)
- Insight: Operational inefficiency may exist in specific warehouses.

#### Shipment Mode by Product weight

Weight in Grams by Shipping Mode
- Ship carries significantly heavier loads (27M grams)
- Flight and Road carry 6M grams each
Despite handling the heaviest shipments (27M grams), the Ship mode shows better delivery performance compared to Flight and Road. This suggests that shipping heavier products via Ship is more reliable, possibly due to bulk logistics optimization. In contrast, Flight and Road, though used for lighter loads, have higher delay rates indicating that delays may be due to operational inefficiencies rather than product weight.

#### Shipment Mode vs Delivery Timeliness

- Road had the highest percentage of late deliveries
- Ship performed better but still had delays
 Insight: Shipment method strongly influences delivery performance, Flight is not significantly faster.

 #### Customer Call by Resolution Status

 Resolved vs Unresolved Calls
- Calls are split 50/50 between resolved and unresolved
- Insight: Equal distribution suggests a need for better resolution handling.
